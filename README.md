# Pre reqs

I am using the [https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/) api for DNS lookup, it requires a key - go there and sign up for the free trial tier (I am going to send mine along in my email submission too just in case)

from root, `touch .env`

inside of your `.env`, create two variables.

`API_KEY='the_api_key_value'`

`PORT=8080`

# Install
`npm install`

# Start
`npm start`
